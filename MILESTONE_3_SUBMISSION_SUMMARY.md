### ✅ **APPLY: Evidence-Based Recommendations (10 pts)**
**Requirement:** Address generalizability, expected value, alternatives, risk using 7 Questions Framework

**7 Questions Analysis Completed:**
1. **Generalizability:** HIGH (95%) - Evidence directly applies to hospitality context (PICOC match)
2. **Expected Value:** 3.9:1 ROI ($225K benefits / $65K investment) over 3 years
3. **Alternatives:** Career development superior to financial incentives (negative ROI) and scheduling improvements (2.1:1 ROI)
4. **Risk Assessment:** MODERATE-LOW with comprehensive mitigation strategies identified

**3 Specific Recommendations:**
1. Structured Career Pathway Program (20% turnover reduction target)
2. Performance-Based Development Investment ($2,000/employee annually)
3. Real-Time Retention Monitoring System (30% reduction in unexpected departures)

### ✅ **ASSESS: Monitoring & Evaluation Plan (10 pts)**
**Requirement:** Logic model (X→M→Y), explicit evaluation design, implementation fidelity

**Logic Model Completed:**
- **X (Intervention):** CDRP with career pathways + development investment + retention monitoring
- **M (Mechanism):** Psychological (satisfaction↑) + Economic (prospects↑) + Social (mentorship↑) + Organizational (pipeline↑)
- **Y (Outcome):** 25% turnover reduction + >4.0/5.0 satisfaction + $150K annual savings

**Evaluation Design:**
- **Method:** Before-and-after with time-series analysis + industry benchmarking
- **Timeline:** 18-month evaluation (6-month baseline + 12-month implementation)
- **Controls:** Economic factors, seasonal variation, management changes, external events
- **Decision Criteria:** Continue if ≥15% turnover reduction + positive ROI

### ✅ **Creating Your Final Dashboard (50 pts)**
**Requirement:** Professional presentation with narrative flow, visual design, coherent user experience

**Narrative Flow & Coherence:**
- Complete EBM story: ASK → ACQUIRE → APPRAISE → AGGREGATE → APPLY → ASSESS
- Consistent terminology and framing throughout all sections
- Clear connections between evidence synthesis (88% confidence) and recommendations
- Professional writing quality with no placeholder text remaining

**Visual Design & Formatting:**
- **Bayesian Analysis Summary Table:** Visual confidence progression by evidence type
- **Evidence Convergence Map:** Four evidence types → 88% confidence recommendation
- **Visual Logic Model Diagram:** Complete X→M→Y with mechanisms and success metrics
- **Implementation Timeline:** 12-month roadmap with resource allocation
- **Risk Mitigation Dashboard:** Priority risks with mitigation status

**User Experience:**
- Coherent navigation from problem identification through implementation planning
- Professional portfolio quality suitable for employer demonstration
- GitHub Pages optimized display with enhanced CSS formatting
- Complete story comprehensible to unfamiliar readers
