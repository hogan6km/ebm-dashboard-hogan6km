#### Observational Data
- **Process Observations:** New employee onboarding, manager-employee meetings, team interactions, exit interview processes
- **Workflow Analysis:** Daily operations, task delegation, communication workflows, feedback mechanisms
- **Communication Patterns:** Manager-employee interaction frequency, information flow between departments, feedback loops
- **Cultural Observations:** Work environment dynamics, employee engagement behaviors, management styles, recognition practices

## Access and Permissions

### Data Access Strategy
#### Required Permissions
- **Data Custodians:** HR Director (employee data), Finance Manager (cost data), Operations Manager (performance data), IT Director (system access)
- **Approval Process:** Management approval for employee surveys, HR approval for personnel data access, IT approval for system data extraction
- **Privacy Considerations:** Employee personal information protection, confidential salary data restrictions, individual performance review privacy
- **Confidentiality Requirements:** Non-disclosure agreements for sensitive financial data, employee anonymity in research reporting

#### Contact Plan
1. **Primary Contact:** HR Director, Sarah Johnson
   - **Data Sources:** HRIS database, turnover reports, exit interview data, training records, performance evaluations
   - **Approach:** Formal request through management with research proposal and data use agreement

2. **Secondary Contact:** Operations Manager, Mike Rodriguez
   - **Data Sources:** Operational performance metrics, customer satisfaction data, scheduling systems, productivity reports
   - **Approach:** Direct request with explanation of business case and confidentiality assurances

### Ethical Considerations
- **Employee Privacy:** Aggregate data only, no individual identification, secure data handling protocols, limited access controls
- **Data Security:** Encrypted storage, password protection, limited data retention period, secure disposal procedures
- **Use Limitations:** Research purposes only, no individual performance evaluation, no disciplinary action basis, academic use exclusively
- **Reporting Boundaries:** Aggregated data only in external reports, no company-specific financial details, no individual employee information

## Data Analysis Plan

### Baseline Establishment
#### Pre-Problem Baselines
Historical retention rates averaged 75% annually (2020-2022) with seasonal variations between 70-80% depending on holiday hiring cycles and economic conditions.

#### Normal Operating Ranges
Normal retention: 70-80% annually; concerning levels: 60-70%; crisis levels: <60%. Normal turnover costs: $2,000-2,500 per departure; concerning levels: $2,500-3,000; crisis levels: >$3,000.

#### Benchmark Comparisons
Industry standard retention rates: 65-75% for retail sector. Internal targets: 80% annual retention. Competitor analysis shows top performers achieving 85%+ retention through comprehensive management training.

### Problem Evidence Analysis
#### Problem Indicators
Current retention rate at 60%, 150+ departures annually, turnover costs exceeding $450,000 yearly, manager confidence scores below 60%, employee satisfaction declining 15% year-over-year.

#### Problem Severity Measurement
Calculate retention rate trends, cost per departure analysis, time-to-replacement metrics, customer satisfaction correlation with staffing stability, manager effectiveness ratings.

#### Root Cause Investigation
Exit interview trend analysis, manager training completion correlation with team retention, compensation competitiveness analysis, career development opportunity assessment, workload and scheduling pattern review.

### Solution Feasibility Analysis
#### Resource Assessment
Current training budget: $50,000 annually. Available manager time: 2-3 hours/week for development activities. Leadership support: demonstrated through retention task force creation and budget allocation.

#### Capability Assessment
Management team has 60% completion rate on existing training. Organization successfully implemented customer service training (85% completion). Change management history shows 70% success rate on process improvements.

#### Risk Assessment
Potential resistance to increased manager accountability, competing priorities during peak seasons, budget constraints if early results don't materialize, manager turnover during training period.

## Documentation Strategy

### Data Collection Log
Maintain spreadsheet tracking: data source, collection date, contact person, data quality assessment, analysis completion status. Weekly progress updates with timestamp and data validation notes.

### Analysis Documentation
Document all calculations, assumptions, and methodology in analysis workbook. Maintain narrative summary of key findings, data limitations, and confidence levels. Create visual dashboards for trend analysis.

### Quality Assurance
Cross-verify HRIS data with payroll records, validate survey responses through follow-up interviews, check financial data against budget reports, confirm observational data through multiple sessions.

### Version Control
Use dated file naming convention, maintain master data folder with access controls, document all data updates and revisions, archive previous versions with change logs.

## Expected Challenges

### Data Availability
Historical training effectiveness data may be incomplete, detailed exit interview records inconsistent before 2023, customer satisfaction data not consistently linked to staffing levels, peer organization benchmarking data limited.

### Data Quality Issues
HRIS system data entry inconsistencies, survey response bias toward engaged employees, incomplete exit interview documentation, financial data allocated across multiple cost centers.

### Access Barriers
IT security protocols for data extraction, manager availability during peak seasons, confidentiality concerns from leadership, employee reluctance to participate in surveys.

### Time Constraints
Data extraction requests require 2-3 week lead time, peak retail seasons limit manager availability, survey administration requires 4-week window for adequate response rates.

## Backup Plans

### Alternative Data Sources
If HRIS unavailable, use payroll departure dates; if surveys impossible, conduct focus groups; if financial data restricted, use industry cost benchmarks; if internal benchmarking limited, use published industry reports.

### Proxy Measures
Use absenteeism rates as engagement proxy, overtime costs as understaffing indicator, customer complaint volume as service quality measure, internal promotion rates as development effectiveness gauge.

### Simplified Analysis
Minimum viable evidence: current retention rate, turnover costs, basic manager training completion rates, simplified employee satisfaction assessment, high-level resource availability confirmation.
