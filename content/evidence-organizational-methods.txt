## 10 Barriers Framework Assessment - MODULE 9 REQUIREMENT ✅

### Barrier Assessment for Career Development Implementation
Using Module 9 framework to evaluate organizational readiness:

**1. Awareness & Knowledge Barriers**
- Current State: Limited awareness of career development ROI
- Data Needed: Manager knowledge assessment, training history

**2. Motivation & Goals Barriers**  
- Current State: Competing priorities (cost control vs. development)
- Data Needed: Strategic plan alignment, budget allocation patterns

**3. Resources & Capacity Barriers**
- Current State: Small business resource constraints
- Data Needed: HR capacity, training budget, time allocation

**4. Social & Cultural Barriers**
- Current State: Traditional hierarchical hospitality culture
- Data Needed: Employee surveys, management attitudes

**5. Legal & Ethical Barriers**
- Current State: Employment law compliance concerns
- Data Needed: Legal review requirements, policy constraints

**6. Economic & Financial Barriers**
- Current State: ROI uncertainty for development programs
- Data Needed: Cost-benefit analysis, budget impact modeling

**7. Political & Stakeholder Barriers** 
- Current State: Owner vs. manager priorities may differ
- Data Needed: Stakeholder influence mapping, decision authority

**8. Technological & Infrastructure Barriers**
- Current State: Limited HRIS for tracking development programs
- Data Needed: System capabilities, integration requirements

**9. Implementation & Process Barriers**
- Current State: No formal career development processes
- Data Needed: Current practices audit, workflow analysis

**10. Measurement & Evaluation Barriers**
- Current State: Limited metrics tracking for development outcomes
- Data Needed: KPI framework, measurement system design

## BLS Data Collection Plan - QUANTITATIVE FOCUS

### JOLTS Data Analysis (Monthly Collection)
**Problem-Related Metrics from BLS:**
- Hospitality Quit Rate: 5.6% monthly (vs. 2.3% all industries) - Source: JOLTS Table 1
- Job Openings Rate: 8.2% (indicating replacement hiring) - Source: JOLTS Table 2  
- Hires-to-Separations Ratio: 0.94 (net employment decline) - Source: JOLTS calculations

**Solution Feasibility Metrics:**
- Labor Market Tightness: 1.46 openings per unemployed person - Source: BLS Job Openings
- Wage Growth Rate: 4.2% annually (retention pressure) - Source: QCEW wage data
- Skills Gap Index: Calculated from OEWS occupation data

**Solution-Related Metrics:**
- Metric 1: [Name] - Baseline: [Number] - Data source: [Where to find it]
