## Quality Assessment Approach
Evaluate studies using established critical appraisal criteria, prioritizing peer-reviewed research with quantified outcomes, appropriate sample sizes, and rigorous methodology. Focus on studies most relevant to retail/service sector contexts.

### Research Design Hierarchy
1. **Systematic Reviews/Meta-analyses** - Highest confidence for effect size estimates and generalizability
2. **Randomized Controlled Trials** - Strong causal inference for intervention effectiveness
3. **Quasi-experimental Studies** - Good evidence for real-world implementation outcomes
4. **Cohort Studies** - Valuable for long-term retention pattern analysis
5. **Cross-sectional Studies** - Useful for understanding current state and correlations
6. **Case Studies** - Essential for implementation details and contextual factors

### Quality Criteria Checklist
- [x] Clear research question
- [x] Appropriate methodology
- [x] Adequate sample size (minimum 100 participants for quantitative studies)
- [x] Valid measurement tools (validated retention/satisfaction scales)
- [x] Appropriate statistical analysis (confidence intervals, effect sizes reported)
- [x] Clear reporting of results (CONSORT/STROBE guidelines followed)
- [x] Discussion of limitations (external validity, generalizability addressed)
- [x] Peer-reviewed publication (indexed journals, impact factor consideration)

## Documentation Process
Organize evidence using systematic review matrix with standardized data extraction form capturing study characteristics, interventions, outcomes, effect sizes, and quality ratings.

### Reference Management
Use Zotero reference manager with tags for intervention type, study quality, effect size magnitude, and applicability to retail sector. Maintain master bibliography with quality ratings.

### Evidence Extraction Form
Standardized data extraction capturing:
- Citation details (authors, journal, year, impact factor)
- Study design and methodology (RCT, cohort, cross-sectional, etc.)
- Sample characteristics (n=, demographics, industry, organization size)
- Key findings (effect sizes, confidence intervals, statistical significance)
- Relevance to your problem/solution (retail applicability, intervention similarity)
- Quality assessment (risk of bias, external validity, GRADE rating)

## Challenges and Limitations
Academic database access limitations, publication bias toward positive results, limited retail-specific research, heterogeneous intervention definitions across studies.

### Search Limitations
Some high-impact management journals require institutional access, grey literature difficult to locate systematically, international studies may have language barriers, recent studies not yet indexed.

### Resource Constraints
Academic database access limited to university library hours, comprehensive search requires 15-20 hours, full-text access may require interlibrary loans with 1-2 week delays.

### Topic-Specific Challenges
Retention interventions vary widely in definition and measurement, outcome measures inconsistent across studies, follow-up periods range from 6 months to 3 years affecting comparability.
