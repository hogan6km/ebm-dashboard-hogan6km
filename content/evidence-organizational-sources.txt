## Synthesis of Organizational Evidence

### Strongest Evidence for Problem Existence
The convergence of 35% annual turnover (vs 18-22% industry average), declining customer satisfaction (3.4/5.0 from 4.1), and measurable revenue impact ($185 vs $220 revenue/hour) provides compelling quantitative evidence. Customer complaints increased 180% while service resolution dropped to 68%, directly correlating with turnover spikes in customer-facing roles.

### Strongest Evidence for Solution Feasibility  
Electronics department's superior performance (18% turnover, 4.2/5.0 satisfaction) with structured mentoring demonstrates internal capacity. Historical data showing 22% turnover and 4.1/5.0 satisfaction two years ago proves organizational ability to achieve target metrics. Available $200K budget with 3:1 ROI requirement aligns with projected retention program costs and benefits.

### Evidence-Based Organizational Readiness Assessment
Strong readiness indicators include 65% employee willingness to participate in development programs, established budget allocation process, and proven ability to achieve target metrics historically. Mixed readiness shown in skill gaps (leadership development needs) and current low management support ratings (2.6/5.0), requiring focused management training component.

### Critical Success Factors Based on Internal Evidence
Management skill development is crucial given 2.6/5.0 rating and correlation between stable management (Electronics) and performance. Systematic mentoring approach proven effective internally. Focus on customer-facing departments (service, sales floor) where turnover impact is most severe. Sustained leadership support essential given successful historical performance when comprehensive programs existed.
