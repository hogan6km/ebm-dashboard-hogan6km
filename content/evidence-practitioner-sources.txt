### Problem-Related Insights (Published Interview - HospitalityNet Nov 2025)
#### Problem Recognition
- **Experience with This Problem:** "I've been in sales leadership for 20 years. I've seen the same pattern repeat: best performers leave not for competitors, but due to organizational chaos"
- **Problem Frequency:** Describes this as a consistent pattern across hospitality sales teams over two decades
- **Problem Manifestation:** "Death by a thousand transformations" - constant organizational changes that exhaust top performers
- **Root Causes:** Leaders creating instability through continuous process changes rather than focusing on fundamentals

- **Preferred Solutions:** "Stop asking 'What do we need to change?' and start asking 'What do we need to protect?'"
- **Successful Examples:** "I killed three initiatives before they launched" - resulted in 94% tool adoption, 22% quota improvement, zero turnover

- **Best Practices:** Build predictability, recovery periods, and give team members voice in changes

#### Implementation Guidance

- **Resource Requirements:** Leadership discipline to resist pressure for constant change

#### Implementation Guidance
- **Critical Success Factors:** Management buy-in and participation, dedicated coaching resources, clear measurement system, patience for 6-9 month culture change timeline

The Electronics department success proves your organization can do this. Build on that foundation and use those managers as internal champions. Expect 6-month minimum commitment and measure everything - what gets measured gets managed in retail."
