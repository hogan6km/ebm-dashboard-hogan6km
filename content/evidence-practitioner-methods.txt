## Expected Challenges

### Access Challenges
Retail managers are often time-constrained and may be hesitant to share proprietary information about retention challenges. Geographic dispersion may limit in-person meetings. Senior practitioners may require more formal introduction or referral process.

### Response Rate Concerns
If response rates are low (<30%), expand outreach to include assistant managers and department leads, leverage multiple contact channels (LinkedIn + email + phone), offer shorter interview formats (15-20 minutes), and provide more specific value propositions.

### Quality Concerns
Ensure valuable insights by developing detailed interview guide with probing questions, conducting practice interviews to refine approach, requesting specific examples and metrics, and cross-referencing responses with multiple practitioners for validation.

### Time Constraints
Limited timeframe requires focused outreach to highest-value contacts first, simultaneous multi-channel contact approach, flexible scheduling including evenings/weekends, and efficient interview structure maximizing insight per minute invested.

## Backup Plans

### Alternative Sources
If direct practitioner access is limited, pivot to published case studies from Harvard Business Review and McKinsey, attend virtual retail conferences for networking, engage with retail consultants who work with multiple organizations, and utilize industry association webinars and panel discussions.

### Modified Approaches
Adapt methods by shortening interview format to 15-20 minutes, offering written questionnaire alternatives, conducting group interviews with multiple practitioners, using informal coffee chat formats, and leveraging existing professional relationships for introductions.

### Minimum Viable Evidence
Minimum viable practitioner evidence includes 3-4 detailed interviews with experienced retail managers, 2-3 comprehensive case studies from recognized companies, and validation through industry association resources or consulting firm publications demonstrating real-world retention strategy implementation.
