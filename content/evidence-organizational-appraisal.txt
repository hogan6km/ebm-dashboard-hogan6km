## Overall Data Quality Assessment - GOVERNMENT DATA SOURCES

### Data Source Reliability - BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS ✅

#### Primary Data Sources
**Data Source 1:** JOLTS (Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey)
- **Reliability Rating:** HIGH - Gold standard for US labor market data
- **Data Collection Method:** Monthly survey of 21,000+ establishments, stratified sampling design
- **Update Frequency:** Monthly releases with seasonal adjustments
- **Historical Availability:** Consistent data series from December 2000 to present (24+ years)
- **Known Limitations:** 2-month reporting lag, establishment-level data (not individual), voluntary survey with 94% response rate

**Data Source 2:** QCEW (Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages)
- **Reliability Rating:** HIGH - Administrative records from unemployment insurance system
- **Data Collection Method:** Administrative data from state unemployment insurance programs (nearly universal coverage)
- **Update Frequency:** Quarterly reports released 6 months after reference quarter
- **Historical Availability:** Complete data series from 1975 (50+ years of historical data)
- **Known Limitations:** Excludes self-employed, federal employees; 6-month reporting delay; aggregated data only

**Data Source 3:** OEWS (Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics)
- **Reliability Rating:** HIGH - Large-scale establishment survey coordinated with state agencies
- **Data Collection Method:** Semi-annual mail survey of 1.2 million establishments over 3-year cycle
- **Update Frequency:** Annual publication (May) with 3-year rolling average
- **Historical Availability:** Consistent methodology since 1996 (28+ years)
- **Known Limitations:** Excludes self-employed, volunteers; occupation coding complexity; 3-year averaging smooths recent trends

**Data Source 4:** Employee Benefits Survey
- **Reliability Rating:** MEDIUM-HIGH - Comprehensive but smaller sample size for hospitality sector
- **Data Collection Method:** Biennial survey of employee benefit offerings
- **Update Frequency:** Every 2 years
- **Historical Availability:** 1980s to present with consistent methodology
- **Known Limitations:** Smaller hospitality sample, self-reported benefit data, 2-year gaps

#### Data Integration Assessment
**Cross-System Consistency:** HIGH - All BLS surveys use consistent industry classifications (NAICS) and establishment sampling frames
**Data Definition Consistency:** HIGH - Standardized definitions across BLS surveys, documented methodology changes
**Temporal Alignment:** GOOD - Overlapping reference periods allow cross-validation, though different reporting frequencies

### Measurement Quality Analysis - BLS HOSPITALITY METRICS ✅

#### Validity Assessment
**Face Validity:** EXCELLENT - BLS measures directly capture hospitality turnover problem
- **Problem Relevance Score:** HIGH - JOLTS quit rates, job openings, and separations directly measure turnover problem
- **Direct vs. Proxy Measures:** DIRECT MEASURES - Actual quit rates, not proxy indicators; real establishment data

**Construct Validity:** HIGH - BLS measures accurately capture theoretical concepts
- **Measurement Alignment:** EXCELLENT - Turnover constructs (quits, separations, job openings) align perfectly with retention theory
- **Confounding Factors:** CONTROLLED - Seasonal adjustments, industry-specific analysis isolates hospitality patterns from broader economic trends

#### Reliability Assessment  
**Internal Consistency:** HIGH - Multiple BLS surveys show consistent hospitality turnover patterns
**Temporal Reliability:** HIGH - Consistent month-to-month and year-over-year patterns in hospitality data
**Inter-rater Reliability:** NOT APPLICABLE - Administrative and survey data, not subjective ratings

#### Statistical Validity
**Sample Size Adequacy:** EXCELLENT
- JOLTS: 21,000+ establishments nationally
- QCEW: Near-universal coverage (99%+ of establishments)  
- OEWS: 1.2 million establishments over 3-year cycle
- Hospitality subset: 50,000+ establishments across all surveys

**Sampling Methodology:** RIGOROUS
- Stratified sampling by industry, size, geography
- Probability-based selection ensures representativeness
- Regular sample refresh maintains current coverage

**Criterion Validity:** EXCELLENT - BLS data correlates with external industry standards
- **External Validation:** BLS hospitality data aligns with private industry surveys (ADP, PayScale, Glassdoor)
- **Predictive Value:** JOLTS turnover data successfully predicts industry hiring needs and wage pressure trends

#### Error Source Analysis
**Error Sources:** MINIMAL - Government data collection standards minimize errors
- **Systematic Errors:** LOW RISK - Standardized definitions, consistent methodology, quality control procedures
- **Random Errors:** LOW RISK - Large sample sizes reduce random variation, seasonal adjustments smooth noise
- **Human Errors:** LOW RISK - Electronic data collection, automated validation, professional survey administration

### Bias Assessment - BLS DATA EVALUATION ✅

#### Selection Bias
**Data Availability Bias:** 
- **Risk Level:** LOW - BLS uses probability sampling, not convenience sampling
- **Issue:** Some small hospitality establishments may be underrepresented in surveys
- **Impact:** MINIMAL - Large sample sizes and weighting procedures address coverage gaps

**Survivorship Bias:**
- **Risk Level:** MEDIUM - Data includes only operating establishments, not those that closed
- **Issue:** Establishments that closed due to extreme turnover are not captured in ongoing surveys
- **Impact:** MODERATE - May underestimate true scope of turnover problem in hospitality industry
