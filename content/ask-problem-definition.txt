## X → Y Framework
### Current State (X - What's happening now that's problematic?)
The hospitality industry is experiencing persistently high employee turnover rates, with many workers leaving within the first year of employment. This leads to frequent staff shortages, increased recruitment and training costs, and decreased service consistency and guest satisfaction.

Frontline hospitality employees such as hotel receptionists, housekeepers, food and beverage staff, and managers — as well as the organizations that employ them.

### Intervention (I - What solution/action are we considering?)
Implementing comprehensive employee retention strategies such as increased career development opportunities, competitive compensation and benefits, supportive leadership practices, and improved work-life balance initiatives.

### Comparison (C - What alternatives exist?)
Maintaining current HR practices without additional retention efforts, or focusing solely on financial incentives without addressing cultural or developmental needs.

### Outcomes (O - What will success look like?)
Reduced annual employee turnover rate
Improved employee satisfaction and engagement scores

Lower recruitment and training costs

### Context (C - Where/when does this apply?)
Applies to the hospitality industry, particularly hotels and resorts in the United States, with a focus on current post-pandemic labor market challenges and evolving employee expectations.
