## Evidence-Based Problem Refinement

### Original Problem Statement
High employee turnover in retail environment negatively impacting customer service quality and organizational profitability, requiring evidence-based retention strategy implementation.

### Evidence-Refined Problem Statement  
Evidence reveals a multifaceted retention crisis with 35% annual turnover (vs 18-22% industry average) driven primarily by inadequate management support (rated 2.6/5.0), insufficient development opportunities, and lack of structured mentoring. The problem extends beyond basic retention to encompass customer satisfaction decline (3.4/5.0 from 4.1), revenue impact ($185 vs $220 per hour), and systematic management skill deficiencies across departments.

**Key Refinements:**
- **Scope Changes:** Problem extends beyond individual retention to systemic management practices affecting entire customer experience chain and organizational culture
- **Root Cause Updates:** Primary driver is management capability gaps rather than compensation or scheduling issues; proven internal success model exists (Electronics department 18% turnover)
- **Impact Reassessment:** Customer impact more severe than anticipated with 12% decline in repeat revenue and 2.3% market share loss directly correlating with retention issues
- **Stakeholder Effects:** Management team needs development as much as front-line employees; customers experiencing measurable service quality degradation affecting loyalty and lifetime value
