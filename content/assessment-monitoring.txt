## Data Analysis Plan

### Quantitative Analysis

#### Outcome Analysis
**Primary Outcome Analysis:** Employee Retention Rate Improvement
- **Statistical Approach:** Time series analysis, chi-square tests for retention differences, survival analysis for tenure patterns
- **Comparison Strategy:** Pre-implementation vs. post-implementation periods, with 12-month rolling averages and seasonal adjustments
- **Significance Criteria:** 15% improvement in retention rate (from 60% to 75%) sustained over 6 months, with 95% confidence interval

**Secondary Outcome Analysis:** Employee Satisfaction and Cost Reduction
- **Statistical Approach:** Paired t-tests for satisfaction scores, cost-per-hire variance analysis, correlation analysis between training investment and retention
- **Comparison Strategy:** Before/after comparisons with control adjustments for market conditions and seasonal factors
- **Significance Criteria:** 20% increase in satisfaction scores, 25% reduction in turnover costs, positive ROI within 12 months

#### Trend Analysis
**How You'll Examine Trends Over Time:** Monthly cohort analysis tracking retention rates by hire date, implementation phase, and department; regression analysis to identify trend patterns and predict future outcomes
**Patterns You'll Look For:** Gradual improvement in retention rates post-training, reduced time-to-departure for early leavers, improved manager confidence correlating with team retention, seasonal patterns in effectiveness, department-specific implementation success variations

### Qualitative Analysis

#### Thematic Analysis
**Interview Analysis Approach:** Inductive thematic analysis using constant comparative method, with interviews transcribed and coded using qualitative analysis software (NVivo or similar)
**Coding Strategy:** Initial open coding followed by axial coding to develop categories; codes organized around implementation experience, barrier identification, success factors, and unintended consequences
**Theme Identification:** Themes identified through pattern recognition across interviews, with inter-rater reliability check using second coder for 20% of transcripts; themes validated through member checking with participants

#### Content Analysis
**Document Analysis Approach:** Systematic content analysis of performance reviews, training materials, and policy documents using predetermined categories and emergent themes
**Observation Analysis:** Behavioral coding of manager-employee interactions using structured observation protocols, with frequency counts and quality ratings analyzed for patterns and changes over time

### Mixed Methods Integration
**How You'll Combine Quantitative and Qualitative Findings:** Sequential explanatory approach where quantitative results identify trends and patterns, followed by qualitative analysis to explain why changes occurred and how implementation factors influenced outcomes; joint displays comparing statistical results with thematic findings
**Triangulation Approach:** Data source triangulation (employees, managers, HR records), method triangulation (surveys, interviews, observations), and investigator triangulation (multiple analysts); convergence and divergence patterns will be systematically examined to strengthen validity
